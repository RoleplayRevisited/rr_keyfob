# rr_keyfob
A simple keyfob script to control your car
You can open your trunk/frunk, lock/unlock your car, start/stop your car, trigger your alarm and control your windows.
Also have a look at the config, there are a few things you can toggle.

I hope you will enjoy this simple resource ;)

## Usage
To open the keyfob press `I` this can be changed by the user in their keybindings
When the button is pressed the keyfob will appear and nui focus will be on. 
There are a few buttons the player can click (see image below)

As you can see you have four buttons + the screen. The screen will be updated at a later time to have multiple pages and even more control.
For now you have the following buttons:

- Left Side -> Open trunk (or if the engine is in the rear open frunk)
- Right Side -> Toggle Engine
- Unlock Icon -> Unlock the car | Double press to trigger the alarm
- Circle -> Lock the car
- Screen -> Each window button opens a specific window (top left opens fron left window, etc etc)

## Roadmap
If there is interest in this resource I will probably rewrite a bit of the code to make it cleaner. 
And I will also add multiple pages to the screen. The pages I was thinking of creating
- Fuel page (See amount of fuel left)
- Door Control page (Control the vehicle doors)
- More to come....
